# BikeSharing

## Overview
Using CitiBike data from New York City, we are creating visualizations to inform a data driven proposal for adding a similar service in another US city. We are trying to convince investors that there is value in adding this transit system in Des Moines, Iowa (a city with a vastly different population size).

The following link will provide a view of the Bike Data Visualizations created to provide some background for our proposal.

## Results

Des Moines, although smaller, could benefit from a CitiBike transportation system being implemented for their citizens. The walking score (calculated based on walkability of city streets and ease of transport around the city) sits at a 48, offering a moderate score. However, implementing a CitiBike transit style bike system would offer better travel options for people going to and from work or just taking in the sights as tourists.

This first visualization will assist in understanding the current demographics that are using the CitiBike system most often.

As seen from the chart, there is a disproportionately large number of "MALE" riders using the system at early hours. This could be attributed to some early morning/late night rides as well as Male Identifying riders being the most common for this service.

We can infer a bit more about the trips being taken with the following heat map visualization created:

The most frequently used time for this service during the week is at two specific times: around 8 AM and between 5-6 PM. With this information and some common sense, we can suggest that these riders are going to and from work at these times, potentially using CitiBike as their main mode of transportation for their standard workday. However, looking at the weekend days, we see different times for heavier flow of traffic. On Saturday and Sunday, we can assume there would be a higher number of tourists traveling the city and using the service to take in the sights.

From this visualization, it appears that the most consistent users are going to be male subscribers of the CitiBike service on weekdays. There is consistently a higher number of users that are subscribers using the service regardless of gender, but this helps us understand how we could try and promote the service in our own city.

## Conclusion

Based on the data we created visualizations for, we can make pretty definite assumptions about the typical use of the service. We can see that most often riders are Male identifying and using the travelability of the bikes for work commuting. Given that there is likely the same need of workers traveling in Des Moines (given scaled back due to the population) for work, we can assume the service would be a good fit. 

To grasp a better idea of who is exactly using the service and why, potentially adding a survey option for some users could inform us if the people using the bikes are travelling, commuting, or using it for leisure. We could create a bar chart or pie chart to visualize this data. Another suggestion could be finding the distance traveled by riders to determine what kind of commutes or trips they are taking.
